# What I Studied

- 이 레포지토리는 업무를 수행하는 과정에서 알게된 지식들을 정리하는 레포지토리입니다.
- This repository is for organizing knowledge acquired during the process of performing tasks at work.
- 브라우저나 프론트엔드에서 부터 개발 전반에 이르기까지 여러 부분의 내용을 정리하려 합니다.
- I intend to organize content covering various aspects, from browsers and frontend to the overall development.
